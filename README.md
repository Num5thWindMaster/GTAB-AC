**This repository hosts the codebase for GTAB-AC.**

To run the code:

1. Follow the steps under `preprocessing/` to collect:
   - OTU abundance matrices (csv)
   - Association matrices (for feature enhancement, csv)
   - The SILVA refseq fasta (fasta)
2. Place all collected data in the projectâ€™s `data/` directory.

<br><br>
**Training**:

Execute `pl_ptrain.py` to train the model.

<br><br>
**Prediction**:

Run `pl_predict.py` to generate simulated predictions for pre-processed, feature-aligned datasets.
